# Motivation

> This is a quote

This is normal text

This is an attempt at using MathJAX: $e^x = \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty}{\frac{x^i}{i!}}$.

1. The series above is very cool
2. Wow, I can use MathJAX
3. Wow again, I can make an enumerated list

More text yada yada


# Nice header

Describing what this header section will discuss

- [Github](https://github.com/) A link to github, clickable and also colour coded red, this text is green!

# Some more header testing

This is a code block, basically gibberish but it could be cool in the future :).

This is a fun iPy script that'll run a nice soothing song that is totally unrelated to the song name in the link
```py
from IPython.display import Audio

sound_src = "https://www.cjoint.com/doc/16_09/FIsxS52QXY7_Rick-Astley---Never-Gonna-Give-You-Up.mp3"

Audio(sound_src, autoplay = True)
```
# Uno mas header
